<p> This Welcoming TDM program was held at the beginning of University admission. </p>
<p>I as the "Jawatankuasa Perwakilan Kolej" should create a program to mark our welcome students to university. </p>
<p>The program is held for one day only, and the program is filled with exciting activities. </p>
<p> I hold a position as a multimedia and was assigned to make posters, take pictures, make banners and more. Students also have a positive impact because they are so diligent in responding to challenges in every activity.</p>
<p> This program has had a profound effect on me because I have the opportunity to make this program a success.</p>

<p> This program is held to strengthen the relationship between the existing Universities in Malaysia. </p>
<p> Among the Universities and schools called are Kota Bharu Polytechnic, SMK Agama Melor, SMK Machang, and many more.</p> 
<p> I hold the position of bureau of programs & activities. This bureau plays a very important role because it involves program programs, guest energy and more. </p>
<p> Through this program I got a great experience because this program I got a lot of friends.</p>
